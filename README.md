You can also be the part of this chain to promote some good open source projects on README of your open soure project. Please raise an issue to suggest your project name. You must be the author of that project.

We also welcome your ideas about how we can make this initiative successful.

## How would it look like

A banner about your open source project (created by you) will be placed in the bottom of the README.md for the defined time period. 

## Rules

All the entries are free. This is just to promote some good open source projects which have capabilities but not known by many developers or they need more popularity.

1. Participate in the voting system where you can submit your project with summary and banner.
2. Ask other developers to vote for any entry without any biased thought.
3. Project with minimum 4 votes would be qualified for the promotion.
4. In case of any dispute or objection, your ad can be removed anytime.
5. We can change the rules without any prior acknowledgement.
6. Already popular projects will either not be qualified for the promotion or will be taken after other projects.

This idea is in it's inception phase so keep patience
